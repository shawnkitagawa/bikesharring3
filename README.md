2. The second graph illustrates that there is a high demand on male who use the bike rather than other gender.
3.  the third graph shows that there are alot of people using 7 am to 9 am and also 6pm to 9pm during the weekdays. We can assume people especially workers is using bike as a transporation before and after work. On the weekends, there is not much demand on early and late days rather than that, people like to use during day time.

5. The last graph tells in what time do peple often rent a bike. Same as the other graph, this graph tells that 7 to 8 am and 5 to 8pm is the peak of the number of people renting a bike.



# Summary 
In conclusion, there are a lot of male who like to use bike as a transportaion to go to work and also after work, range of 10 to 20 min apart from working place. We can expect a low risk with small volatiliy on the profit for this business model because this bike-sharing program is targetting mainly workers who are looking to use bike as an transportation. Since, alot of worker are relying bike as a transportaion, there's low possibility that the demand of bike renting will decrease.
